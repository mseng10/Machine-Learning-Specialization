unsupervised learning - ask the alg. to find commonalities in data
clustering - find if the data can be grouped

k meanns
 - intiial guess at cluster centroids
 - see which ones are closest 
 - pick new centroids until convergence 


k-means alg.
 1) Randomly intiialize K cluster centroids (k is number axis)
 2) for i to  m: find which ones are cloesest
 3) Move cluster centroids
 
cost function of k means - minimize average square distance for datapoints to their cluster

intiializing k-means
 - choose K < m 
 1) randomly pick K training examples
 2) Set u_1..k equal to these K examples (bing bong)
 3) Run different times to pick best intiializer
  - minimizing cluster centroids 

anomoly detection

density estimation - find features of x that have low/high probaility
